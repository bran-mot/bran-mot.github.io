The Windows Phone design team annually publishes a playbook documenting their evolution as a creative team. It tells the story of the team's innovation, flexibility, and dedication. The team asked for concepts concepts for layout and design that captured the metro design language and a human-centered feeling. 

The delivered concepts documented the history, people and process of the metro design language. The solution used a well thought out grid system against bright, playful colors to reinforce the idea of a creative machine. The wide range of the palette and imperfect photography gave the design a sense of beautiful imperfection.
